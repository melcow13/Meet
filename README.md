# Meet
To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

# Key Features:
1. Filter events by city.
2. Show/hide event details.
3. Specify number of events.
4. Use the app when offline.
5. Add an app shortcut to the home screen.
6. View a chart showing the number of upcoming events by city.

# User Stories
1. As a user, I would like to be able to filter events by city so that I can see the list of events
that take place in that city.
2. As a user, I would like to be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less
information about an event.
3. As a user, I would like to be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the
app so that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once.
4. As a user, I would like to be able to use the app when offline so that I can see the events
I viewed the last time I was online.
5. As a user, I would like to be able to add the app shortcut to my home screen so that I
can open the app faster.
6. As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each
city so that I know what events are organized in which city.
